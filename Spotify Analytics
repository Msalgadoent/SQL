-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1 What is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability) as avg_danceability
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#2 Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT artist_name, SUM(popularity) as total_popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY total_popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#3 What artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

#4 What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT AVG(danceability) as avg_danceability
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#5 Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, 
show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH artist_popularity AS (
    SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
    FROM Spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name
)

SELECT artist_name, avg_popularity, 
CASE WHEN avg_popularity >= 90 THEN 'Top Star' ELSE '' END AS label
FROM artist_popularity
WHERE avg_popularity >= 90
ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC;
