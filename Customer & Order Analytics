--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orders were placed in January? Filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs.

SELECT COUNT(*) as num_orders
FROM JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL AND orderID != '';

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(*) as num_iPhone_orders
FROM JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL AND orderID != '' AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM FebSales
JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id;

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT Product, price
FROM JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL AND orderID != ''
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * price) as revenue
FROM JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL AND orderID != ''
GROUP BY Product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product

#9 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?

SELECT location, COUNT(orderID) AS NumOrders
FROM JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%New York%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >= 3

#10 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY Product

#11 What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#12 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#13 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT Product, SUM(price * Quantity) AS TotalRevenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 1
